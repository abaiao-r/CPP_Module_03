## Project Overview

This project is designed to explore and apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. It consists of a series of exercises aimed at developing a strong foundation in C++ and OOP concepts, with a focus on inheritance.

## Significance and Relevance

C++ is a versatile programming language with a rich history, and understanding OOP in C++ is essential for any aspiring software developer. This project offers practical experience in core C++ concepts, preparing you for more advanced C++ development.

## Key Concepts in Focus

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Inheritance
- Constructors and Destructors
- Member Functions
- Encapsulation

## Exercise 00: Aaaaand... OPEN!

**Introduction:**

In Exercise 00, you will create your first class named ClapTrap. This class will serve as a foundation for subsequent exercises. ClapTrap will have attributes and member functions to simulate its behavior.

**Relevance:**

Exercise 00 is essential because it introduces you to class creation, constructors, and member functions, setting the stage for more advanced exercises.

**Key Concepts:**

- Class Definition
- Constructors and Destructors
- Member Functions
- Attribute Initialization

## Exercise 01: Serena, my love!

**Introduction:**

In Exercise 01, you will build on your knowledge by creating a derived class called ScavTrap. ScavTrap inherits from ClapTrap and introduces new attributes and behavior.

**Relevance:**

This exercise reinforces your understanding of inheritance in C++ and how to customize derived classes.

**Key Concepts:**

- Inheritance
- Derived Classes
- Overriding Member Functions

## Exercise 02: Repetitive work

**Introduction:**

Exercise 02 extends your project with the FragTrap class, another derived class from ClapTrap. FragTrap has its attributes and unique behavior.

**Relevance:**

This exercise further demonstrates the power of inheritance and the creation of distinct derived classes.

**Key Concepts:**

- More Inheritance
- Custom Constructors

## Exercise 03: Now it's weird!

**Introduction:**

Exercise 03 introduces the DiamondTrap class, inheriting from both FragTrap and ScavTrap. It blends attributes and behavior from two parent classes.

**Relevance:**

This exercise challenges your understanding of multiple inheritance and working with complex class hierarchies.

**Key Concepts:**

- Multiple Inheritance
- Ambiguity Resolution

# Conclusion

In this project, we embarked on a journey through the world of C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). We explored key concepts, such as classes, inheritance, constructors, destructors, and member functions, while building a foundation in C++ development.

Each exercise provided valuable hands-on experience and allowed us to reinforce our understanding of C++ and OOP principles:

- **Exercise 00: Aaaaand... OPEN!** introduced us to the basics of class creation and initialization. We learned how to define a class, work with member variables, and implement member functions.

- **Exercise 01: Serena, my love!** expanded our knowledge by demonstrating the power of inheritance. We created a derived class from ClapTrap, customized it with unique attributes and behaviors, and delved into overriding member functions.

- **Exercise 02: Repetitive work** further solidified our understanding of inheritance. We crafted another derived class, FragTrap, with its own set of attributes and capabilities, showcasing the flexibility of class hierarchies.

- **Exercise 03: Now it's weird!** challenged us with multiple inheritance. We created the DiamondTrap class, inheriting from both FragTrap and ScavTrap. This exercise pushed the boundaries of our knowledge, requiring us to resolve ambiguity and work with complex class structures.
